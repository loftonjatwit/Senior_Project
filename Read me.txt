This is the project files for our project. You have to install and run Mongo DB Compass for it to work.
After MongoDB server is running, from there you can connect to the server from the compass.
Once you have connected it install both the backend and frontend.
The open Vidual Studio code, if you haven't installed it install that then open it.
Once Visual Studio Code is open on the backend file and then in the terminal run "npm install", "npm run build" and then "npm run start"
Eventually it will say that it is connected to the server.
Then open another Visual Studio Page and then open the frontend and in the terminal run "npm install, "npm run build" and then "npm run start"
Eventually a webpage should open having our project and the information.
